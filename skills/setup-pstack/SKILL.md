# Setup pstack

Write `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md`, a user-level rule loaded every session that sets pstack's model per role. The skills read it and fall back to their inline defaults when a line is absent, so this is an override layer, not a requirement.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Enumerate the values you can pass as an `Agent` subagent's `model` in this session — `fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` — that is the dependable source; check the valid values in the Agent tool's error message if one is rejected. If you cannot detect any, ask the user to paste the values they have access to. Never write a real value you have not confirmed is available. The alias `inherit` is always valid even though it is not a detected value.

### 2. Load current state

The default role-to-model mapping is the rule shape shown in step 5 below. If `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` already exists, read it and treat its values as the current choices. Otherwise start from those defaults.

### 3. Map and confirm

Show every role with its current model, marking any real value not in the detected set as needing a choice. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit` (this role runs on the parent chat model) as the options. Prefer AskUserQuestion over free text. For panel roles (how critics, arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it different from the parent's when possible. If the `openai-codex` plugin is installed, seating a Codex model in a panel or cross-judge list buys you a genuinely different model family, which the Anthropic tiers alone cannot. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Validate

Every real value written must be in the detected set; `inherit` always passes. If a chosen real value is not available, stop and ask again. A rule pointing at a model the user cannot use breaks every delegation that reads it.

### 5. Write the rule

Write `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` with no frontmatter and one line per role, using the same labels poteto-mode uses. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent. Shape:

```
# pstack model configuration. One line per role. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default.
# `inherit` as a value: the role runs on the parent chat model (omit Agent `model`). Alias entries in a panel list still count toward its fan-out.

### 6. Confirm

Tell the user the rule was written and that it applies to new sessions. Re-running this skill updates it.

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-verification-skill` (resolves wherever pstack is installed — workspace, user, or plugin). On no, move on without pushing.
