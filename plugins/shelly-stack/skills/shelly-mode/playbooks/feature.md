### Feature

**You own the design. Plan, review, verify.** Delegate implementation. Stay in the lead.

1. `how` over the affected subsystem.
2. `architect` for parallel design exploration. Skipping stays as `architect skipped: <reason>`. Do not fold the design decision silently into implementation.
3. Write the throughput checkpoint as four todo items. A dimension that genuinely does not apply (single file, no fan-out) keeps its item with `n/a: <reason>` rather than being dropped:
   - **Blocking first steps.** Gates run before fan-out.
   - **Independent workstreams.** Disjoint files, services, or layers parallelize. Shared writes serialize.
   - **Shared mutable state.** Default to splitting the target (the **[separate-before-serializing-shared-state](../references/routed/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/workflow.md)** principle skill). Serialize only for real invariants.
   - **Smallest safe decomposition.** If one worker is best, name why.
4. Delegate code-writing to a subagent using the configured `feature` `<model>@<reasoning_effort>` pair or the native runtime fallback with a specific scope (file paths, named data shape and its organizing structure per **[principle-model-the-domain](../references/routed/principle-model-the-domain/workflow.md)**, such as a state machine over scattered booleans, a table/registry over branching, a typed model over repeated shape assumptions, chosen before the delegate writes logic, and success criteria); review its diff yourself. When the implementation admits multiple valid shapes (error handling, abstraction layer, test structure), delegate via the **[arena](../references/routed/arena/workflow.md)** skill instead so the runners surface the alternatives and the cross-judge guards the pick. Mandatory at any app size, with no skip-with-reason escape; Laziness Protocol does not override it because the gain is review separation, not lines saved. A subagent can spawn its own delegate. One that cannot owns the diff itself with the same review separation, and never idles waiting on a nested agent. Comments per **Comments**. Surgical edits, re-ground against the source for upstream-derived files. Port shared-primitive improvements to all consumers and verify each. Keep the verified change in the working tree unless the current request explicitly authorizes commits.
5. Verify on the matching surface. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it.
6. Use the **[sequence-verifiable-units](../references/routed/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/workflow.md)** principle skill to build and verify each small unit before the next. If commits and rebases are explicitly authorized, shape those units into a small ordered history; otherwise preserve the verified working-tree diff.
7. If the design is contested, `interrogate` before shipping.
8. If the current request explicitly authorizes PR creation and pushing, run **Opening a PR**. Otherwise stop with verified local changes.

Code-coupled work (one feature, one migration) goes to a single owner with the checkpoint inline. That owner fans out internally after the blocking phase. Parent-level fan-out is for slices that produce independent artifacts (audits, cross-subsystem investigations, competing experiments). Rewrite the checkpoint at phase boundaries. Spawn a fresh owner rather than chaining interrupts.

**Reply:** what you built, what you chose and why, the throughput checkpoint, open decisions. Tables for design alternatives.
