# Code Quality Review

Each reviewer applies this code-quality lens in addition to the rubric. It is a strict standard focused on implementation quality, maintainability, abstraction quality, and codebase health.

Look past local cleanup for restructurings that preserve behavior while making the implementation smaller and more direct. Dimension 0 below defines that bar.

## Dimensions

Each dimension is stated once. Apply the ones that are relevant.

0. **Be ambitious about structural simplification.** Do not stop at "this could be a bit cleaner." Look for reframings that make whole branches, helpers, modes, conditionals, or layers disappear. Assume a "code judo" move is often available. It uses the existing architecture more effectively and makes the change dramatically simpler. If you can delete complexity rather than rearrange it, push hard for that.

1. **Flag a file crossing 1,000 lines when the new material has a coherent separate responsibility.** Size is evidence to inspect, not a reason to split cohesive code mechanically. Prefer extracting helpers, subcomponents, or modules when the responsibility is separable.

2. **Do not allow spaghetti growth in existing code.** Be suspicious of new ad-hoc conditionals, scattered special cases, or one-off branches inserted into unrelated flows. Treat "weird if statements in random places" as a design problem, not a style nit. Prefer pushing the logic into a dedicated helper, state machine, or module instead of tangling an existing path.

3. **Bias toward cleaning the design, not just accepting working code.** If behavior can stay the same while the structure becomes meaningfully cleaner, push for the cleaner version. Prefer simplifications that remove moving pieces over refactors that spread the same complexity around.

4. **Prefer direct, boring, maintainable code over hacky or magical code.** Treat brittle, ad-hoc, or "magic" behavior as a problem. Be skeptical of generic mechanisms that hide simple data-shape assumptions. Flag thin abstractions, identity wrappers, or pass-through helpers that add indirection without buying clarity.

5. **Push on type and boundary cleanliness when it affects maintainability.** Question unnecessary optionality, `unknown`, `any`, or cast-heavy code when a clearer type boundary could exist. Prefer explicit typed models over loosely-shaped ad-hoc objects. If a branch leans on a silent fallback to paper over an unclear invariant, ask whether the boundary should be made explicit.

6. **Keep logic in the canonical layer and reuse existing helpers.** Call out feature logic leaking into shared paths or implementation details leaking through APIs. Prefer existing canonical utilities over bespoke one-offs. Push code toward the right package, service, or module instead of normalizing drift.

7. **Treat unnecessary sequential orchestration and non-atomic updates as design smells when the cleaner structure is obvious.** If independent work is serialized for no reason, ask whether it should run in parallel. If related updates can leave state half-applied, push for a more atomic structure. Do not over-index on micro-optimizations, but do flag avoidable orchestration complexity that makes the code more brittle.

## Output Expectations

Prioritize structural code-quality regressions and missed simplifications first, then spaghetti and branching complexity, then boundary, type, and file-size concerns, then smaller modularity and legibility issues. Do not flood the review with low-value nits when larger structural issues exist. Prefer a few high-conviction comments over a long list of cosmetic notes.

## Severity bar

Correct behavior does not lower severity. Rate these `warning` or higher and name the structural fix, not a rename: incidental complexity a code-judo move would delete; a file pushed from under 1,000 lines to over; ad-hoc branching that tangles an existing flow; feature checks scattered across shared code; an unnecessary abstraction, wrapper, or cast-heavy contract; a duplicated helper or logic outside its clear canonical home.
